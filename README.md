# ðŸŒŸ Safe-LLaVA: Removing Biometric Information from Vision Language Models

This repository reproduces and extends the [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) project by systematically **removing biometric information** (e.g., gender, race, age) from the training data.  
We introduce **Safe-LLaVA-OneVision**, a privacy-conscious version of LLaVA, and propose a new evaluation protocol called **BIAS (Biometric Information Awareness and Safety Benchmark)**.

For more details on environment setup and advanced usage, please refer to the original [LLaVA GitHub page](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA).
